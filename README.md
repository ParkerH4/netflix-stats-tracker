## Description
This is a fun little project I wanted to build for my own enjoyment in order to see some fun stats about all the shows and content in general I have watched on Netflix.
The actual data shown is just a sample data for demonstration purposes, in order to get the real data you have to request it from Netflix at this [site](https://www.netflix.com/account/getmyinfo).

This was a great project to also deepen some of my Python skills as I have never done any sort of Data Visualization let alone work with a lot of basic Python packages.

## Installation

**Requirements:** 
* Make sure you have Python installed on your computer (You can download Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
* Proper IDE to run Python files (I used Visual Studio Code as my choice of IDE but others will work)
* Get personal netflix data from their site or use sample one provided

Use this command to install the libraries required for this project
> pip install *library_name*

Install the following libraries :
1. pandas
2. dash
4. plotly


## Usage
Before running the application in order to test your own data, make to change the filepath to the appropriate one being used.

After running the Python script in the IDE it will setup and display a localhost URL that contains the dashboard as shown above.

**This code tracks the following statistics from the data:**
* Total Hours Watched
* Total pieces of content watched (shows or films)
* Unique pieces of content watched (shows or films)
* Top 10 shows based on watch time
* Top 10 shows based on biggest binge (sorted by most episodes watched in a day)
* What device is used to watch Netflix on the most?
* What day of the week is Netflix watched on the most?
